# Virtual-Memory-Simulator-using-FIFO-
Operating system LAB final project: Virtual Memory Simulator

this program uses FIFO for replacement of pages and also simulates TLB cache
Context switching is implemented for fun

How to use:
just compile and run the code

issues:
i havent implemented any error or exception handling yet 
this means you have to specifically write page1 to load page 1 and it HAS to be in the virtual memory otherwise the code will break :)
